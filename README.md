## Tech stack

This made using Typst and it was a wonderful experience. To be more specific:
- The presentation was made with Touying and the dewdrop theme
- The diagrams were done with Fletcher
- The source code was edited using Helix and tinymist (LSP)
- The additional graphs were done using Matplotlib (Python in a Marimo notebook)
